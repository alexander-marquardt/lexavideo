LexaVideo provides the source code for running a fully responsive web-app that features real-time browser-based 
video conferencing and text chat.

LexaVideo was originally developed for ChatSurfing.com. Check out ChatSurfing.com for an active demo of this source code in action.

This software relies on WebRTC for the video transmission, and is built using AngularJS and Python. 
It is designed to run on Google AppEngine.

See http://www.lexavideo.com for full details of how to use this software to build your video-enabled website.
