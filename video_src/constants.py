Make sure that unicode characters don't cause crashes when entered as a chat room name.
Try testing the javascript and the server with the following string: I√±t√´rn√¢ti√¥n√†liz√¶ti√∏n‚òÉüí©

The following characters are reserved with special meaning in the URL, and should not be allowed in room names.
         $&+,/:;=?@"<>#%{}|\^~[]

We also forbid the following characters because they may confuse the server
         '/' (forward slash), \s (blank space),

We also forbid the following characters, just in case we want to use them for internal purposes in the future
         '*', '''

(note that in the regexp below, that '\', '[', ']', '/', '*', and ''' are escaped with '\')

valid_chat_room_name_regex - The initial caret means that the regexp must match starting at the beginning
of the string. The ending $ means that the regexp must match all the way to the end of the string.
The characters between the '[' and the ']' is the set of characters that we are matching against, however
because the first symbol is '^' this is a negative match, which means that we are matching all characters
not in this set.
The '+' symbol before the '$' means that we must match at least one or more characters
