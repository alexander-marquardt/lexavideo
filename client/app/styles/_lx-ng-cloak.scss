/*
The ng-cloak directive was added to Angular in order to prevent the flickering of elements
before your application has fully loaded. Angular will remove ng-cloak from each element once it has had a chance
to compile your views.

However, using just the built-in ng-cloak, there is still a flicker issue that occurs between when the
view is first loaded and before Angular has had a chance to run. This occurs because Angular
sets the ng-cloak css with javascript as opposed to in a .css file.

By explicitly setting ng-cloak in css, we are able to cloak any html elements immediately and before
Angular has had a chance to run. This prevents the above mentioned flickering.
