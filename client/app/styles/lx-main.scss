/* Icomoon fonts used in this site are currently based on a combination of standard icomoon.io icoMoon-Free,
   fontawesome-webfonts, and custom fonts that were uploaded in SVG format.
   Icomoon provides functionality for creating new font packages that contain only the desired characters/icons.
   If the font file needs modification, then a new file can be created by uploading the icomoon.svg file to
   the icomoon server for inclusion in a new font file which will be generated by icomoon.
