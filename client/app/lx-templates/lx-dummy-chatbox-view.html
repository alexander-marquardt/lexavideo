<!-- Because there is a small (maybe 500ms) delay when showing the appropriate chatbox in lx-chatbox.html,
     we load a "fake" chatbox panel as soon as the view is shown. This provides a sense of immediate response
     to the user. Read comments in lx-chatbox.html for more information on the problem that this overcomes.

     The panels in this file should mirror the panels in lx-chatbox.html -->
